                <h3>Bad Website Design - <a href="https://hamilton.craigslist.org/">Craigslist</a></h3>
                <h4> Issues - </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li> Craigslist has a very inconsistent design throughout its web pages.</li>
                    <li> When you switch web pages on Craigslist you are flashed with the entire website transforming and seeming more cluttered than it already is.</li>
                    <li> The colour scheme is also not that appealing to the eye but its also not tortuous.</li>
                    <li> There is an ease of navigation on the home page, but that's also the home page is literally just the navpage.</li>
                    <ul> <li> Things That Were Designed Well - </li>
                        <li> Universal Accessibility and Usability, as the webite conforms to different width/height ratios. </li>
                        <li> Craigslist also has good Error Prevention for their website as it actually looks decent as well and when typing in the wrong link it takes you to a 404 page which directs you back.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

                <h3>Good Website Design - <a href="https://www.codedex.io/home">Codedex</a></h3>
                <h3> Greatness -  </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> Every webpage has the same colour scheme and style, and functionality throughout the entire webpage is easy to understand and works the same throughout. </li>
                    <li> There are also a lot of GIFs and animations throughout the web page as well, which makes it look very good too, and this is throughout the entire website. </li>
                    <li> The website is very easy to explore and use since the navbar is at the top, and it's very minimalist and hovering over it shows additional options for the navbar, 
                        and it does not feel so cluttered like Craigslist did. Even within the courses themselves, in the bottom left, there is a navigation button for you to go to other levels.
                    </li>
                    <li> It works very well for every device option on Google’s developer tools </li>
                    <li> While the website is designed well even for mobile, it is still annoying to actually use on mobile since we feel it could be a bit more optimised.
                    </li>
